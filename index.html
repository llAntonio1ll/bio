<p>I am what keeps me going in life. When I feel like I want to give up, I rely on my determination to help me get through whatever that may be. Friends and family can help you through tough times, but it's really up to you to make the decisions. Whenever people tell me something, I take it into consideration but only use what is best for me. My biggest role model is myself. You are probably wondering why. Well, you're not going to have someone in every situation you're in. If you become reliant on just having someone to fight your own battles, you wouldn't be able to make it on your own.</p>

</div>
<p>It is good to have someone to have your back, but you also have to be able to fight your own battles. I also trust a few people. However, I mostly keep what is bothering me to myself. I keep it to myself because I don't fully trust them. I also don't want to tell them every little thing that is bothering me. There was a time, however, when I was more outgoing and social than I am now. Every now and then there will be someone that may stick up for me, but most usually just watch and then ask if you're ok as if they care. If they really cared, they would've helped you and not watch. Relying on myself has made my life so much better, but even that is not perfect. People will always go after you, but if you can take it, you will get by with ease. I do think however, you should have at least one friend. I have more than one, but I only have maybe one or two I could trust a little but not a lot about a few things maybe more.</p>

</div>
<p> I would like to be more outgoing as I was when I was younger, but I didn't have anyone that I could trust at the time. Life is a lot better for me since then. You just have to do what is best for you. I don't believe this is best for me or anyone else, but this has worked for me for a while, so I'm going to stick with it until it doesn't work for me anymore. One day, I might be more outgoing like I was when I was younger. I just need to find someone I can fully trust to help me out.</p>
